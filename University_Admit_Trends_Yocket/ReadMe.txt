ABOUT THE PROJECT:

Yocket is a popular website among the candidates seeking for higher education (mainly Masters/PhD) in the Unites States.It holds valuable information about each applicant such as his/her:
GRE Score, 
TOEFL/ILETS Score, 
CGPA, 
Work Exp., 
Universities Applied, 
Term of Joining,
etc...

However, as the website focuses on displaying information of candidates individually, it becomes hard to analyze/visualize the trends of a perticular university.
Thus, this small application gathers the data from the website and using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib to visualize some trends that the universities tend to possess in Accepting or Rejecting a candidate.

[It is a known fact that the universities do not make a decision only based on the scores and the CGPA of a candidate. Factors such as Letter of Recommendations, Statement of Purpose also play an important role in making any decision. But such kind of an analysis helps a candidate generate a brief picture of what kind of a profile a university is looking for its program. This will help an aspirant to make a more precise list of Universities of his/her interest and also roughly anticipate his chances of getting an Admit.]
